		<h3>Tuesday and Thursday morning, 8-10am | 415 E. Menomonee Street</h3>
		<p>Every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 8-10 am we have &#8220;Open Lab Sessions&#8221; at our space located at 415 E. Menomonee St. While we pour coffee freely, a fantastic cast of (mostly) Milwaukeeans participate in conversation about everything from innovation and the definition of creativity to creating change in the community. You’re more than welcome to join us—no secret password required. Would you like to suggest a topic for an upcoming lab session? Send us a note, we’d love to hear from you.
