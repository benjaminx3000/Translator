				<h3>Tuesday and Thursday morning, 8-10am | 415 E. Menomonee Street</h3>
				<p>Every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 8-10 am we have &#8220;Open Lab Sessions&#8221; at our space located at 415 E. Menomonee St. While we pour coffee freely, a fantastic cast of (mostly) Milwaukeeans participate in conversation about everything from innovation and the definition of creativity to creating change in the community. You’re more than welcome to join us—no secret password required. Would you like to suggest a topic for an upcoming lab session? Send us a note, we’d love to hear from you.

			<p>Have something a little more specific you’d like to cover during Open Lab, maybe even related to a recent challenge you’d like some feedback on? That’s where Focused Labs come in.  How it works… submit your request. Chosen topics will be scheduled during an Open Lab session, we’ll post the scheduled event and invite people that may be a good fit to help with the issue. Our only criteria is that Lab is not a time to sell your company/services but a time to get open feedback on a challenge or question you have.</p>

			<p>With such great response to the open lab concept, we’ve developed a way to utilize the platform within organizations focused on their challenges. myLab is a new problem solving service, aimed at infusing outside expertise into your in-house team to collaboratively work through an issue facing your business.</p>
			<p>Through a flexible framework of working sessions and activities customized to your issue, teams work through the myLab structure of Problem Framing, Guided Thinking and Solution ID, ultimately resulting in a strategic, narrowed direction of solution recommendations. Interested? Drop us a line and let’s chat.</p>
