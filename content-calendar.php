				<p><strong>Lab Series</strong>- Lab is hosted by Translator every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 8-10 am and is always open to the community.  The topics vary, but on any given day you may stop in at at one of our lab series: Open Lab sessions, Focused Lab sessions or Startup Lab sessions. <a title="Lab" href="http://www.stage.translatordigitalcafe.com/new-site/lab/">Find out more about Lab.</a></p>

				<p><strong>Experience Series</strong> - These events are generally hosted at Translator in the evening and focused on expanding the opportunity for exploring different learning opportunities. Some previous Experience Series events we've hosted include a LP release event for the band 1913, the showing of indie move "Miss Representation" (hosted offsite at UWM Union theatre), and an Author Series events with both Chris Guillebeau and Austin Kleon. <a title="Experience Series" href="http://www.stage.translatordigitalcafe.com/new-site/experience-series/">Check out more details on #xsmke.</a></p>

				<p><strong>Partner Events</strong> - Partner events revolve around topics that the Translator crew are passionately involved with, but are coordinated by others that want to make great use of the Translator space and community relationships. Popular partner events we've hosted include StartUp Wisconsin and PechaKucha MKE.</p>

				<p><strong>Speaking Events</strong> - We love to share what we know, and the art of storytelling. If you think we'd be a good fit for your event, we'd love to hear more. We're available to speak on a variety of topics including user experience, creativity in business, or design thinking to name a few.</p>
